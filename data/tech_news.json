      "title": "The Reason Why OLED TVs Are So Expensive",
      "summary": "Ever wondered why those gorgeous OLED TVs carry such a premium price tag? It boils down to groundbreaking tech and intricate manufacturing! Unlike traditional LCDs, each OLED pixel is self-emissive, generating its own light for unparalleled blacks and vibrant colors. Achieving this pixel-perfect brilliance isn't cheap. The production process for these organic light-emitting diodes is incredibly complex and delicate, especially for large panels. This leads to lower manufacturing yields and specialized factories, primarily from a few key players. Essentially, you're investing in cutting-edge innovation and the painstaking precision required to deliver that breathtaking visual experience. It’s the ultimate cost of unparalleled visual perfection right into your living room!",
