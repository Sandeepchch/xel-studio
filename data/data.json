      "content": "*LM Arena – Day 1 Experience*\n\nLM Arena is a research-driven platform developed by the LMsys research community, focused on fair and transparent evaluation of large language models (LLMs). It allows users to test AI models through real-world, side-by-side comparisons, giving a clear picture of how each model actually performs. Most importantly, it is completely free and open to everyone.\n\n*Why LM Arena Matters*\n\nThe AI space is moving extremely fast, with new models launching frequently. However, not everyone wants—or is able—to pay for multiple premium subscriptions just to test them. LM Arena solves this problem by providing access to 50+ high-quality models, including premium and pro-level models, all in one place. Whenever a new model is released, users can quickly test:\n\n- New and experimental models\n- Premium and pro models\n- Performance differences across tasks\n\nThis makes LM Arena an ideal platform for testing, learning, and research.\n\n*My Personal Usage & Research Approach*\n\nI personally use LM Arena for exploration and comparison-based research. Instead of relying on claims or hype, I test models directly to understand:\n\n- Which model performs best for a task\n- Where a model struggles\n- How accurate and reliable responses are\n\nThe side-by-side comparison feature gives a clear and practical understanding of model behavior—especially for reasoning, coding, and general intelligence tasks.\n\n*Model Selection Based on Use Case*\n\nThrough consistent testing on LM Arena, I’ve been able to clearly decide which model suits which purpose:\n\n- For general tasks, I use Gemini 3 Pro\n- For complex and advanced use cases, I use Opus 4.5\n\nThis kind of clarity is only possible when models are compared directly under the same conditions.\n\n*Why Choosing the Right LLM Is Critical*\n\nAn LLM is the brain of any AI agent.\n- A strong LLM → the agent performs efficiently\n- A weak LLM → the agent struggles\n\nSelecting the right LLM based on context and task complexity is essential. When you know which model to use and when, you can significantly improve productivity, accuracy, and overall results.\n\n*Final Thoughts*\n\nHumans have limitations, but AI systems have access to vast knowledge. Our strength lies in creativity, planning, and direction. When those are combined with the right LLM, almost any task becomes achievable. LM Arena helps build this understanding. If used properly, it allows you to choose the right model for the right task, every time. \n\nFor those who want to explore LM Arena but don’t know how to start, I’m providing the YouTube link and the website link directly here. Just click the link and start exploring. Anyone can use this platform. You can choose any browser that is comfortable, including those that work well with screen readers, and begin exploring immediately.\n\n Website:  https://lmarena.ai/\n\nYouTube link https://youtu.be/zRvegzTuEak?si=pzgr_4-0fYU0jFkv",

      "title": "Google Antigravity – Free Limited Time? What is Google Antigravity?",
      "image": "https://i.ibb.co/BVG7nYKB/1769717558524.png",
      "content": "Google Antigravity can be understood clearly through these three core aspects:\n\n1. AI-driven coding environment: It goes beyond being a traditional code editor. Instead of only providing inline suggestions, it integrates advanced AI models to actively assist with development tasks.\n\n\n2. Agent-based workflow design: Antigravity is designed around agent-based workflows where AI can plan tasks, execute them, verify results, and iterate automatically, making it suitable for complex development work.\n\n\n3. Built for real applications: It is more suitable for building real features, automation pipelines, and production-ready applications rather than quick edits or small experiments.\n\n\n\nWhen Google Antigravity first launched, I tried it around December, roughly 5 days after release. At that time, the experience felt decent but not particularly special. It worked fine, but it didn’t clearly stand out compared to other AI-assisted coding tools. Most workflows relied mainly on Gemini 3 Pro, which was available for free, but for more complex problems, the results felt limited. Things changed noticeably after Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5 were added, alongside Gemini 3 Pro which continues to be freely available. One useful aspect is that you can choose any one of these three models depending on your task, whether you need stronger reasoning, better code generation, or more structured planning. Opus 4.5 is widely regarded as one of the best coding and reasoning models in the world, and having it available for free is extremely rare. This upgrade clearly improved code quality, long-context reasoning, and multi-step problem solving, while GPT-5 further strengthened planning and execution.\n\nCompared to tools like Cursor and Windsurf, Antigravity feels less like an AI-assisted editor and more like an agent-driven workspace. Cursor excels at fast inline suggestions, and Windsurf focuses on guided coding flows, whereas Antigravity emphasizes task ownership by agents—where a task is planned, executed, verified, and iterated as a complete workflow. This approach works especially well for larger features, automation workflows, and real application development. Another strong aspect is real-time browser verification, where Antigravity can open a browser, test its own output, and confirm whether something actually works, automatically fixing issues when needed and reducing manual testing.\n\nUsing Google Antigravity, I added search functionality in our Rising Telegram bot to provide real-time information, Please note our Telegram bot is offline for 3 days right now. I'll re-host it in 3 to 4 days And at the same time I enhanced my agentic workflows, making them more efficient, structured, and effective. For new users who are unsure how to install or get started, I’ve added a YouTube link that explains the download and setup process step by step, making it easier to begin without confusion.\n\nOverall, Google Antigravity doesn’t feel like a traditional code editor. It feels more like a working AI development system—one that became genuinely powerful only after the right models were added.\n\nYouTube link https://youtu.be/8hydTA2j6ng?si=BraDeFLNQcJBxkaZ",
