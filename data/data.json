      "content": "Let's talk about something most people get wrong about software security. When you try to download an app and see those scary warnings like 'This file may be harmful,' your first instinct is probably to think, 'Nope, this is definitely a virus' and close the browser. So people trust official platforms like Google Play Store, Microsoft Store, or Apple’s App Store instead. But here’s the reality: even these official stores have distributed malware, spyware, and data-stealing apps. Even apps with millions of downloads have later been found quietly collecting user data or showing intrusive ads after an update, long before being removed. There have been cases where apps initially passed store security checks but activated malicious behavior weeks later, exploiting permissions users had already granted. Yes, they eventually fix the issue—but sometimes weeks or months later. By then, thousands of users may already be affected.\n\n*Why Open Source Feels Different*\n\nOpen source changes everything. The entire codebase is public—anyone can inspect it, review it, test it, and report issues. Thousands of developers worldwide act as independent reviewers. If something suspicious exists, it’s usually caught fast. Compare that to closed-source apps, where only a company’s internal team knows what’s happening behind the scenes. Which model feels more trustworthy?\n\nThat said, exercise caution with brand-new open source projects. They might lack a large community yet, so bugs or vulnerabilities could slip through initially without quick detection. Start with established ones to minimize risks, and always verify before diving in.\n\nHowever, the speed of detection and fixing is usually far better than traditional app ecosystems.\n\n*What I Actually Use*\n\n- *ReVanced Manager*: A community-driven open source project that enables premium-like YouTube features. The code is fully transparent, actively reviewed, and constantly updated by the community.\n- *uBlock Origin*: A powerful open source ad and tracker blocker. I’ve used it for years with zero security concerns.\n\nDo these tools break company terms of service? Possibly. But enforcement usually targets projects, not users.\n\n*My Preferred Alternative*\n\n- *Firefox instead of Chrome*: Privacy-focused, highly customizable, and built for users—not data collection.\n\nOpen source isn’t only about security. It’s about freedom, transparency, and trust. Knowing exactly what runs on your device brings peace of mind.\n\n*Staying Safe with Open Source*\n\n✓ Download only from official websites or verified GitHub repositories  \n✓ Check project activity and recent updates  \n✓ Use AI tools to research project safety quickly  \n✓ Avoid fake or cloned versions\n\n*Final Thoughts*\n\nOpen source has changed how I use technology. I feel more in control, more secure, and less dependent on corporate ecosystems. The code is transparent, communities are active, issues are fixed quickly—and it’s genuinely free.",

When you try to download an app from a browser and see those scary warnings like \"This file may be harmful,\" your first instinct is probably to panic. You think, \"Nope, definitely a virus,\" and close the tab. Most people retreat to the safety of the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, assuming they are bulletproof.\n\nBut here’s the reality: Official stores aren't perfect. Even these trusted platforms have unknowingly distributed malware or apps that quietly steal data. We’ve seen cases where apps passed security checks, gathered millions of downloads, and only later were caught activating malicious behavior. By the time the issue is fixed, thousands of users are already affected. To be fair, app store security has improved, but no centralized system can catch everything—that's where community review shines.\n\n*Why Open Source Feels Different*\n\nThis is where open source flips the script. In the proprietary world (like Google or Microsoft), only a few internal engineers see the code. In the open source world, the entire codebase is public. Think of it like a restaurant with an open kitchen. Anyone—from expert developers to curious students—can walk by, inspect the ingredients, and see exactly how the food is made. It's a \"many eyes\" approach that creates strong transparency—though it only works when the community is actively reviewing code.\n\nEven major projects like OpenSSL had the Heartbleed bug hiding for 2 years.\n\nNote: Always exercise caution with brand-new open source projects that lack a community history. But for established projects, the speed of detection and fixing can be superior for actively maintained projects compared to traditional app ecosystems.\n\n*What I Actually Use*\n\nI don’t just talk about this; I live it. Here are the three tools I rely on daily that prove the power of this community:\n- _ReVanced Manager_: A community-driven project that unlocks premium YouTube features for free. Because the code is transparent and actively reviewed by a massive community, I trust it more than many closed apps.\n- _uBlock Origin_: I’ve used this on my PC and phone for years. It blocks ads and trackers without mercy, making the web safer and faster.\n- _Firefox_: Instead of Chrome, I use Firefox. It's built for privacy first, not for ad-driven data collection. It's highly customizable and puts the user first.\n\n*Important Legal Note*\n\nWhile tools like ReVanced are open source and technically safe from malware, using them often violates a company's Terms of Service. There is a possibility that your account could be restricted. I use them fully understanding this risk because the benefits are worth it to me, but you should decide for yourself if you are comfortable with that trade-off. The security risk from malware is minimal with official sources, but the policy risk is real.\n\n*Staying Safe: The Golden Rule*\n\nOpen source is safe, but the internet is still the internet. The biggest danger isn't the software itself, but where you download it.\n- The Rule: Always download from the official source (usually GitHub or the official website).\n- The Warning: Never trust random \"Download APK\" sites found on Google. Bad actors love to take open source code, inject malware, and upload it to fake sites. If you stick to the official community links, you are safe.\n\n*Final Thoughts*\n\nOpen source has changed how I use technology. I feel more in control, more secure, and less dependent on corporate ecosystems. The code is transparent, the communities are passionate, and the tools are genuinely free. It’s not just about software; it’s about peace of mind.",

      "content": "I’ve been closely observing the recent hype around Clawdbot (also known as Moltbot), especially after watching several videos that explain its free usage, access to premium AI models, and 24/7 automation setup. Even though it looks powerful and tempting, I haven’t started using it yet. Below is my honest understanding of what Clawdbot is, why many people are excited about it, and why I’m personally cautious about using it right now.\n\n**What Is Clawdbot?**\n\nClawdbot is not just another AI coding tool. It works more like an AI employee or coworker rather than a simple chatbot. It acts as a wrapper around advanced AI models such as Claude and Gemini, and it can communicate directly through platforms like Discord, Telegram, Slack, or WhatsApp. It is designed to stay active 24/7 and can automate tasks such as writing and debugging code, checking stock prices, sending reminders, and running scheduled tasks using cron jobs. In simple words, Clawdbot works like a non-stop digital assistant.\n\n**Why Many People Like It**\n\nPeople are mainly excited about Clawdbot for two reasons. First, many videos show ways to use premium AI models for free by connecting Clawdbot with tools like Google Antigravity IDE and Gemini CLI, without paying directly for APIs. Second, it can be run continuously on low-power hardware or cheap VPS servers, which makes it feel like a permanent assistant that is always available.\n\n**Why I Am Careful About Using It**\n\nThe main reason I have not started using Clawdbot yet is concerns about security. To work properly, it needs deep system access, such as terminal permissions, plugins, environment variables, and authentication tokens. If something goes wrong, the risk is not limited to the bot alone—the entire system can be affected. Many setups also depend on unofficial plugins or community scripts, which makes it harder to fully trust what is running in the background. Since the bot stays online 24/7, it also increases exposure to potential risks.\n\n**My Personal View**\n\nFrom my experience, using powerful tools without full control can be risky. Clawdbot is impressive, and the automation looks very useful, but I prefer to move carefully. I believe understanding risks is more important than following shortcuts, and free solutions often come with hidden trade-offs. For now, I prefer using official tools and secure methods where I clearly know what is happening behind the scenes.\n\n**Final Note**\n\nClawdbot is a powerful assistant that can improve productivity if used properly, but it also requires responsibility and awareness. I’m not against using it—I’m simply choosing safety, clarity, and control over hype. When things are more transparent and secure, I’ll definitely consider using it.",

      "content": "These are advanced AI models from major companies, designed to assist with coding and complex tasks. GPT-5.3 Codex is from OpenAI, the team behind ChatGPT. It acts as a quick assistant for writing code, fixing errors, and handling step-by-step computer work. Opus 4.6 comes from Anthropic, a company emphasizing safe and reliable AI. It excels at in-depth planning, logical reasoning, and managing large projects that require forward thinking. People turn to these tools because coding tasks, such as creating websites or apps, can be challenging. They serve as intelligent aids that handle much of the work, reduce time spent, and spot issues.  \n\nAs of February 7, 2026, both models were released recently, generating a lot of discussion online. It feels like a competition in AI for improved coding support. User feedback varies: some prefer one for its speed, others for its intelligence. The positive side is that they are becoming more affordable and efficient. There is no clear leader; the choice depends on the task, such as rapid adjustments or detailed strategies.\n\nAccording to official company details, Opus 4.6 offers extensive memory capacity—up to 1 million tokens in beta mode, or 200,000 standard—which allows it to manage large amounts of information without losing track. It achieves 65.4% on command-line coding tests, 72.7% on general computer operations, a leading 1606 Elo in reasoning challenges, and 80.8% in resolving actual GitHub bugs. Its strength lies in agentic coding, where it independently outlines steps for projects and can scale its thinking effort from basic to advanced. It costs $5 to $25 per million tokens and is readily available on their platform or cloud services. During evaluations, it identified 500 undisclosed bugs in open-source software.\n\nFor GPT-5.3 Codex, the memory limit is 400,000 tokens. It scores 77.3% on command-line coding, 64.7% on computer operations, and 77.6% on cybersecurity assessments. Its key feature is interactivity, enabling real-time guidance during tasks, similar to a conversation to refine plans. It contributed to debugging its own development and runs 25% faster than prior versions. Pricing aligns with earlier models, roughly $10 to $30 per million tokens—it is accessible via paid ChatGPT applications or integrated tools like GitHub Copilot Pro. Both companies highlight security: Opus earns top marks in certain cyber evaluations, while Codex is rated as high-capability for security with additional safeguards.\n\nUser tests show Opus perfect (100%) on simple stuff like 3D plans or games (Gemini 3 Pro matches cheap). For apps like trackers, Opus nails it first go with clean code and good looks. Codex sometimes slips with old tricks like 'cat' commands or login bugs. But Codex shines in fast clones (under 4 mins) or quick fixes, like boosting training speed 1.6%. Opus better for big innovations that stump people. Many mix them: Codex for reviews, Opus for building.\n\nBased on public data and my own tests using Kilo Code and GitHub Copilot Pro (where Codex is available) and LM Arena (where Opus works very well but Codex isn't available), Opus 4.6 leads in reasoning, planning, and logic—ideal for agentic tasks like structuring business apps with seamless steps. It handles big concepts independently. For example, it would thoroughly outline a game with rules and spot flaws. In contrast, GPT-5.3 Codex excels at error detection, code review, and quick fixes—responsive for patching issues like faulty logins, with its fast iterations and self-debugging. When I tested using GitHub Copilot Codex with multiple questions, it reviewed code faster than alternatives. Example prompts: \"Review this Python script for a web scraper—check for efficiency\"; \"Analyze this JavaScript function for a login system—fix any bugs\"; \"Evaluate this bash script for automating backups—identify errors.\" These show its strength in practical reviews. Overall, choose Opus for depth and foresight, Codex for speed in coding and reviews. This competition benefits users with better tools.",

      "title": "LM Arena – Day 1 Experience",
      "content": "LM Arena is a research-driven platform developed by the LMsys research community, focused on fair and transparent evaluation of large language models (LLMs). It allows users to test AI models through real-world, side-by-side comparisons, giving a clear picture of how each model actually performs. Most importantly, it is completely free and open to everyone.\n\n*Why LM Arena Matters*\n\nThe AI space is moving extremely fast, with new models launching frequently. However, not everyone wants—or is able—to pay for multiple premium subscriptions just to test them. LM Arena solves this problem by providing access to 50+ high-quality models, including premium and pro-level models, all in one place. Whenever a new model is released, users can quickly test:\n\n- New and experimental models\n- Premium and pro models\n- Performance differences across tasks\n\nThis makes LM Arena an ideal platform for testing, learning, and research.\n\n*My Personal Usage & Research Approach*\n\nI personally use LM Arena for exploration and comparison-based research. Instead of relying on claims or hype, I test models directly to understand:\n\n- Which model performs best for a task\n- Where a model struggles\n- How accurate and reliable responses are\n\nThe side-by-side comparison feature gives a clear and practical understanding of model behavior—especially for reasoning, coding, and general intelligence tasks.\n\n*Model Selection Based on Use Case*\n\nThrough consistent testing on LM Arena, I’ve been able to clearly decide which model suits which purpose:\n\n- For general tasks, I use Gemini 3 Pro\n- For complex and advanced use cases, I use Opus 4.5\n\nThis kind of clarity is only possible when models are compared directly under the same conditions.\n\n*Why Choosing the Right LLM Is Critical*\n\nAn LLM is the brain of any AI agent.\n- A strong LLM → the agent performs efficiently\n- A weak LLM → the agent struggles\n\nSelecting the right LLM based on context and task complexity is essential. When you know which model to use and when, you can significantly improve productivity, accuracy, and overall results.\n\n*Final Thoughts*\n\nHumans have limitations, but AI systems have access to vast knowledge. Our strength lies in creativity, planning, and direction. When those are combined with the right LLM, almost any task becomes achievable. LM Arena helps build this understanding. If used properly, it allows you to choose the right model for the right task, every time. \n\nFor those who want to explore LM Arena but don’t know how to start, I’m providing the YouTube link and the website link directly here. Just click the link and start exploring. Anyone can use this platform. You can choose any browser that is comfortable, including those that work well with screen readers, and begin exploring immediately.\n\n Website:  https://lmarena.ai/\n\nYouTube link https://youtu.be/zRvegzTuEak?si=pzgr_4-0fYU0jFkv",

      "image": "https://i.ibb.co/BVG7nYKB/1769717558524.png",
      "content": "Google Antigravity can be understood clearly through these three core aspects:\n\n1. AI-driven coding environment: It goes beyond being a traditional code editor. Instead of only providing inline suggestions, it integrates advanced AI models to actively assist with development tasks.\n\n\n2. Agent-based workflow design: Antigravity is designed around agent-based workflows where AI can plan tasks, execute them, verify results, and iterate automatically, making it suitable for complex development work.\n\n\n3. Built for real applications: It is more suitable for building real features, automation pipelines, and production-ready applications rather than quick edits or small experiments.\n\n\n\nWhen Google Antigravity first launched, I tried it around December, roughly 5 days after release. At that time, the experience felt decent but not particularly special. It worked fine, but it didn’t clearly stand out compared to other AI-assisted coding tools. Most workflows relied mainly on Gemini 3 Pro, which was available for free, but for more complex problems, the results felt limited. Things changed noticeably after Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5 were added, alongside Gemini 3 Pro which continues to be freely available. One useful aspect is that you can choose any one of these three models depending on your task, whether you need stronger reasoning, better code generation, or more structured planning. Opus 4.5 is widely regarded as one of the best coding and reasoning models in the world, and having it available for free is extremely rare. This upgrade clearly improved code quality, long-context reasoning, and multi-step problem solving, while GPT-5 further strengthened planning and execution.\n\nCompared to tools like Cursor and Windsurf, Antigravity feels less like an AI-assisted editor and more like an agent-driven workspace. Cursor excels at fast inline suggestions, and Windsurf focuses on guided coding flows, whereas Antigravity emphasizes task ownership by agents—where a task is planned, executed, verified, and iterated as a complete workflow. This approach works especially well for larger features, automation workflows, and real application development. Another strong aspect is real-time browser verification, where Antigravity can open a browser, test its own output, and confirm whether something actually works, automatically fixing issues when needed and reducing manual testing.\n\nUsing Google Antigravity, I added search functionality in our Rising Telegram bot to provide real-time information, Please note our Telegram bot is offline for 3 days right now. I'll re-host it in 3 to 4 days And at the same time I enhanced my agentic workflows, making them more efficient, structured, and effective. For new users who are unsure how to install or get started, I’ve added a YouTube link that explains the download and setup process step by step, making it easier to begin without confusion.\n\nOverall, Google Antigravity doesn’t feel like a traditional code editor. It feels more like a working AI development system—one that became genuinely powerful only after the right models were added.\n\nYouTube link https://youtu.be/8hydTA2j6ng?si=BraDeFLNQcJBxkaZ",
